ContentEditable
===============

The pure javascript you need to make editable content in a browser, and the hooks needed to build out an editor to manipulate that content.  I build this many years ago long before the time of modern JS frameworks and have put it up here in case anyone needs to see what it takes to make content editable in older browsers or even newer ones.
